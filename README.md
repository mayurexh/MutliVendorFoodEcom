    cd MutliVendorFoodEcom
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # If you have a requirements.txt file
    pip install django decouple psycopg2 # Otherwise install listed dependencies
    ```

4.  Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

    touch .env
    ```

5.  Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
